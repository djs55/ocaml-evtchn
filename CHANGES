trunk (unreleased)
* Rename the "unix" subpackage to "xenctrl"
* Add support for Unix IPC using Unix domain sockets
* Add a subpackage for "xen" which will include the mirage-platform C
  bindings eventually
* Add a subpackage "inheap" for signalling via Lwt condition variables

1.0.5 (19-Jun-2014)
* Remove dependency on Unix which crept into 1.0.4

1.0.4 (18-Jun-2014)
* this software is now officially part of the Mirage project
* correct one file which hadn't got the ISC license header
* standardise indenting (ocp-ident --syntax=lwt -i)
* print a helpful error message if you haven't got the xen-evtchn module
  loaded.

1.0.3 (14-Jun-2014)
* xen-evtchn.unix package depends on xen-evtchn. This fixes linking problems
  in downstream libraries.

1.0.2 (13-Jun-2014)
* suppress exceptions in top-level bindings thrown when not able to talk
  to xen. Now this exception will be thrown when the app actually tries to
  use the event channel API, where it's possible to catch and deal with it.
* correct LICENSE to ISC (code is part of the Mirage project)
  This matches the per-file headers.

1.0.1 (30-Jan-2013):
* only build the C stubs if the xen headers are present

1.0.0 (30-Jan-2013):
* import event channel code from mirage
* fix segfault in calling 'pending' (OCaml type changed but C
  stub did not)
* open at-most-one interface per process by caching the connection
